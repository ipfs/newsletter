# IPFS Newsletter #11

[IPFS](//ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities, aiming to make the web faster, safer, and more open. In these posts, we highlight some of the development that has happened since the last newsletter. For anyone looking to get involved, follow the embedded hyperlinks, search the wealth of information on [GitHub](//github.com/ipfs) or join us on [IRC](//webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs) (#ipfs on the Freenode network).

_Note: To be fairer to everyone, we've renamed the Weekly to the Newsletter. We'll still aim for frequent updates._

Here are some of the highlights for the [early May](//github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/105) sprint:

## Updates

### [go-ipfs](//github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)

During this sprint, @whyrusleeping spent a lot of time debugging and fixing the hanging issue with [yamux](https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux). This is the issue that causes (in at least 90% of observed cases) the gateways and other nodes to hang when simple requests are made on them. He has a patch in place and is waiting on upstream code review to get it pushed in officially. During that process he also did a bunch of [gx](//github.com/whyrusleeping/gx) work, refactored the dependency tree of [go-stream-muxer](https://github.com/jbenet/go-stream-muxer) to be more flat, making updating that area of the code easier, and also made the `gx deps --tree` much more visually pleasing.

The logic surrounding defaults in go-ipfs has been clarified somewhat by the inclusion of a standard way to mark defaults, and greater enforcement of making them overtly declared. @RichardLitt went through the codebase making a lot of small PRs to make sure this worked: thanks @whyrusleeping and @Kubuxu for helping out so much. To see all changes, refer to this [issue](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/2484).

Finally, @whyrusleeping fixed and pushed up a performance improvement on [go-multiaddr](https://godoc.org/github.com/jbenet/go-multiaddr). Previously, to create a multiaddr from some bytes, we converted it into a string, and called `NewMultiaddr` on it, which converted it back into bytes. This was eating up an unnecessary amount of CPU time on the gateways. Now we just create it directly.

### [js-ipfs](//github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs)

[Bitswap](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap) has been merged into [js-ipfs](//github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs), as of [this pr](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/195). This means that js-ipfs nodes can now exchange (data) blocks. This is compatible with [go-ipfs bitswap](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/tree/master/exchange/bitswap), but due to the multistream protocols not being a 100% compatible right now we can't connect to go-ipfs nodes yet. As soon as multistream connects, the bitswap implementations should have no problem exchanging blocks. To help out with this or follow along, look at [this issue](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/1549).

### [interface-ipfs-core](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core)

@dignifiedquire and @diasdavid are creating [interface-ipfs-core](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core). This will be a test suite and interface you can use to implement a IPFS core interface. `object` is the first part of it, as of this week. Their work involved writing the Object API spec (as well as laying the foundations to write the remaining API specs), creating a batch of tests, and upgrading [js-ipfs-api](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-api) with the new interface. This unblocks the possibility of swapping js-ipfs-api with js-ipfs for [Orbit](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit).

There are more APIs to tackle in the core. @nginnever will be working on `files` this week, in this [PR](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/pull/8). Feel free to jump in and help out!

To give a bit more background, the primary goal of this module is to define and ensure that both IPFS core implementations and their respective HTTP client libraries offer the same interface, so that developers can quickly change between a local and a remote node without having to change their applications. In addition to the definition of the expected interface, the module offers a suite of tests that can be run in order to check if the interface is used as described.

The API is presented with both Node.js and Go primitives. However, there are no actual limitations keeping it from being extended for any other language, pushing forward cross compatibility and interoperability through different stacks.

###  [js-multihash](https://github.com/jbenet/js-multihash)

[js-multihash](https://github.com/jbenet/js-multihash) now has a more extensive set of tools to convert hashes, thanks to @dignifiedquire. You can look at the new API methods in [the README section for them](https://github.com/jbenet/js-multihash#api). Mostly, these are conversion methods; overall, they help provide a more extensive interface for dealing with [multihashes](https://github.com/jbenet/multihash) in JavaScript.

### [js-multistream](https://github.com/diasdavid/js-multistream)

@diasdavid updated [js-multistream](https://github.com/diasdavid/js-multistream) to match the latest revision of [the multistream spec](https://github.com/jbenet/multistream). He also started working on refreshing the API of the module to make it less wonky: this means writing down the entire interface, upgrading [js-ipfs-api](//github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-api), leveraging what js-ipfs-api already had previously built, and then running the same batch of tests in both [js-ipfs](//github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) and js-ipfs-api and making sure they all pass. In the future, this means that we have the foundation to build up the rest of the core API spec.

### [orbit-db](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit-db)

@haadcode spent the last few days optimizing [orbit-db](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit-db): the write throughput performance is now at ~100ops/s (~33% improvement) and the code base has been fully modularized. orbit-db now uses the following modules as datastores: [orbit-db-eventstore](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit-db-eventstore), [orbit-db-feedstore](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit-db-feedstore), [orbit-db-kvstore](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit-db-kvstore), and [orbit-db-counterstore](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit-db-counterstore).

### Orbit

Orbit also got some love: @haadcode has been integrating the new orbit-db version into it. As well, there are now new contributors: Thanks @masadeus for username auto-complete on 'tab', and thanks @shamb0t for emoji auto-complete and preview. (Emoji auto-complete is not merged yet but will be in the next couple of days).

### [standard-readme](//github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

@RichardLitt made a spec for what a standard readme should look like, and plans to ensure that all IPFS repositories are up to that spec. He has also made a generator to help people create compliant readmes faster. This will help lessen the cognitive load involved with creating and maintaining READMEs. There are plans, in the works, to make a linter, too. If you think readmes are important, jump in with your opinions on the [spec](//github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)!

### common-readme

@noffle has also been working on readmes, by creating [common-readme](https://github.com/noffle/common-readme). This is more Node.js-specific than @RichardLitt's [standard-readme](//github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme), and is aimed at making a standard way of presenting information for NPM modules. @noffle and @RichardLitt are going to spend more time working together and trying to make the best readmes they can.

## Community

### require('lx')

TBD - should we include this? 

@diasdavid gave a talk at require('lx'), a Node and JavaScript meetup in Lisbon. Tweet: https://twitter.com/Sericaia/status/730838055121235968
