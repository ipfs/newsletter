## Announcing the IPFS Pinning Summit

On May 7-8, 2020, the IPFS project is hosting our first-ever IPFS Pinning Summit, and we would love for you to attend! The Summit is geared toward groups that provide pinning or other web/dweb infrastructure services. We plan to discuss the current state of distributed web infrastructure -- including some of the challenges and operational lessons -- and several exciting future opportunities (grants, integrations, potential new markets, etc). We thought it would be a huge value-add if you and/or others on your team were able to attend!
